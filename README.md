Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial wants to modernize their operations. For their coding, they want current and effective software that's also secure. Artemis Financial's goal is for protection of their Restful application when considering vulnerability.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I felt I did well when considering the vulnerabilities that could be considered in the Restful application. I made sure to go through the critical vulnerabilities, but also discussed what needed fixed/updated.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The part of the vulnerability assessment that was challenging for me would be knowing the difference between when to use code quality and code error for consideration. I got help and once my professor explained a situation for each one to use, I was able to distinguish each one.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

For increasing layers of security, making sure the code is up to date, along with increasing the cypher bit rate is the best way. More bits for the cypher means more secure coding with less chance of a leak/attack.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

The best way to make sure code is functional and secure is to run it and test it. In order to test for new vulnerabilities, I've checked with the dependency check. If new problems arose, then they'll need to be discussed and worked through.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

For this class I had to use the 24-7 tutor, along with the professor for help. In addition, I used CHATGPT to try and solve some coding issues I was having with the POM files (though this did not work). These will be helpful in the future as I'll be able to use them and come back to them as needed.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

From this assignment, with the amount of skill I was able to do, I'd show them the dependency report and explain the parts that are the issue when moving forward with the code.
